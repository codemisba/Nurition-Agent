# 🥗 Nutrition Agent — AI-Powered Personalized Diet Assistant

Welcome to **Nutrition Agent**, an IBM SkillsBuild project built with generative AI, NLP, and multimodal learning to deliver **adaptive, personalized meal plans** like never before. Think ChatGPT meets your personal dietician.

🚀 Live it. Train it. Eat better with AI.

---

## 🌟 Problem Statement

Modern nutrition tools be like: "Here’s your generic diet plan."  
But we’re like: "What if AI could craft meals **just for you** — your culture, allergies, goals, even your food pics?"

**Challenge**: Dieticians can’t scale, and current apps are one-size-fits-none.

**Solution**: An AI-powered chatbot that delivers **dynamic, tailored dietary recommendations** at scale.
